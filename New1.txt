To log method invocations and responses in a single line for a request in a Spring Boot application using Logback, without making changes to the existing code, you can use a custom Logback configuration with a ThreadLocal-based approach. This approach captures all method invocations and their responses in the context of a single request and logs them in the desired format.

Step-by-Step Approach:

	1.	Custom Logback Appender: Create a custom Logback appender that aggregates log messages in a ThreadLocal variable and writes them out in one line at the end of the request.
	2.	Logback Configuration: Configure Logback to use this custom appender.

1. Custom Logback Appender

Create a custom appender by extending ch.qos.logback.core.AppenderBase. The appender will store logs in a ThreadLocal variable and flush them as a single log entry at the end of the request.

import ch.qos.logback.core.AppenderBase;
import ch.qos.logback.classic.spi.ILoggingEvent;
import org.slf4j.MDC;

public class AggregatingAppender extends AppenderBase<ILoggingEvent> {

    private static final ThreadLocal<StringBuilder> logBuffer = ThreadLocal.withInitial(StringBuilder::new);

    @Override
    protected void append(ILoggingEvent eventObject) {
        StringBuilder buffer = logBuffer.get();
        buffer.append(eventObject.getFormattedMessage()).append(" | ");
        
        // If the event is the last in the request, flush the log
        if (isEndOfRequest(eventObject)) {
            flushLogs();




        }
    }

    private boolean isEndOfRequest(ILoggingEvent event) {
        // Implement logic to detect end of request (e.g., checking for a specific log message)
        return event.getMessage().contains("END_OF_REQUEST");
    }

    private void flushLogs() {
        StringBuilder buffer = logBuffer.get();
        // Log the accumulated messages
        System.out.println(buffer.toString());
        // Clear the buffer for the next request
        logBuffer.remove();
    }
}

2. Logback Configuration

You need to add this custom appender to your logback.xml configuration. Here’s an example:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>

    <appender name="AGGREGATING" class="com.yourpackage.AggregatingAppender" />

    <root level="INFO">
        <appender-ref ref="AGGREGATING" />
    </root>

</configuration>

3. Ensuring Logging at the End of the Request

To ensure that the log is written out at the end of each request, you could add a marker log message like "END_OF_REQUEST" at the end of your controller methods or wherever you determine the request is fully processed. You can do this without changing the core logic, by using an aspect or a filter.

Note: Using aspects or filters might require some code changes, but this approach provides flexibility for handling logs at the request level.

Summary

With this approach:

	•	Custom Appender: Aggregates logs across the request lifecycle.
	•	Single Log Entry: Logs all method calls and responses as a single line in the desired format.
	•	No Core Logic Change: You avoid modifying the existing business logic by implementing this at the logging level.

This is a high-level overview, and the actual implementation might require adjustments based on your specific use case and Spring Boot setup.
