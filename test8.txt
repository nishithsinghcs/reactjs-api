same hits coming twice for one api request in log

When you observe that the same hits are coming twice for one API request in the logs, it typically indicates that the logging aspect or interceptor is being triggered more than once per request. This can happen due to various reasons, such as multiple proxies or aspects being applied, duplicate method calls, or Spring's internal mechanism.

Here's how you can troubleshoot and address the issue:

1. Check for Multiple Aspects or Interceptors
Ensure that you don't have multiple aspects or interceptors that are logging the same method invocations. If you have other interceptors or aspects configured, they might be triggering the logging aspect multiple times.
2. Use @Order Annotation
If you have multiple aspects in your application, you can control the order in which they are executed by using the @Order annotation. Ensure your logging aspect is executed last if possible.
java
Copy code
import org.springframework.core.annotation.Order;

@Aspect
@Component
@Order(Ordered.LOWEST_PRECEDENCE) // Ensures this aspect runs last
public class LoggingAspect {
    // Aspect code here
}
3. Check Proxy Configurations
Ensure that your application is not creating multiple proxies around your beans. Spring AOP often wraps beans with proxies for aspect-oriented features, which can cause multiple invocations of the same aspect if configured improperly.
4. Avoid Duplicate Logging
To prevent duplicate logs, you can add a check to see if the current method is the root method (the first method that is hit during a request) and only log for this root method:
java
Copy code
@Before("controllerMethods() || serviceMethods()")
public void logBeforeMethod(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
    if (logAccumulator.get().length() == 0) { // Only log if this is the first method
        StringBuilder logBuilder = logAccumulator.get();
        logBuilder.append(joinPoint.getSignature().getDeclaringTypeName()).append(".")
                  .append(joinPoint.getSignature().getName()).append(" | ")
                  .append("Request: ").append(Arrays.toString(joinPoint.getArgs())).append(" | ");
    }
}
5. Use the @Around Advice
Consider using the @Around advice instead of @Before and @AfterReturning. This way, you can control the logging process more effectively by executing the logic exactly once for each API call:
java
Copy code
@Around("controllerMethods() || serviceMethods()")
public Object logAround(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable {
    StringBuilder logBuilder = logAccumulator.get();
    logBuilder.append(joinPoint.getSignature().getDeclaringTypeName()).append(".")
              .append(joinPoint.getSignature().getName()).append(" | ")
              .append("Request: ").append(Arrays.toString(joinPoint.getArgs())).append(" | ");
    
    Object result = joinPoint.proceed(); // Execute the method

    logBuilder.append("Response: ").append(result).append(" | ");

    if (isRootMethod(joinPoint)) { // Only log once per API request
        logger.info(logBuilder.toString().replaceAll("\n", "").replaceAll("\r", ""));
        logAccumulator.remove();
    }
    return result;
}

private boolean isRootMethod(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
    // Implement logic to determine if this method is the root of the API request
    return true; // Simplified for this example
}
6. Check Spring Boot Filters
Make sure you donâ€™t have multiple filters or servlets inadvertently logging the same request multiple times.
7. Enable Debug Logs
Temporarily enable debug logs for Spring AOP or your application to trace which aspects or interceptors are being applied. This can help you identify where the duplication is coming from.
Summary
By carefully structuring your logging aspect and ensuring no redundant logging occurs at multiple levels of your application, you can prevent duplicate logs and have cleaner, single-line log entries for each API request.
